List of email ids to whitelist Oracle Cloud Free Signup


Hi Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well.

We would like to thank Oracle for free OCI trainings and certifications. These are indeed very helpful in enhancing cloud career. I have read somewhere that OCI certified personnel is Oracle troop for cloud battle and it is true. I hope Oracle will continue to train its troop with the latest and greatest level of knowledge.

As we have discussed during our webinar meeting. Following is the list of the email id of our community members who are going to use for OCI free signup. It will be a great help if you could whitelist and bypass the credit card requirement. I have validated all the accounts for any duplicates. I have attached the sheet with all the details if required.

Take care stay safe.
